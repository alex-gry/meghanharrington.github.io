# Why this study?

<font size="1"> 
The last few years, we have seen the rising of lots of movement fighting for **civil rights**, whether it is **anti-racist**, **feminist** or in our case, for **gay rights**. Indeed, it seems that with the **liberation of speech** thanks to **social networks**, every one can have a voice and not only journalists, politicians or personnalities on TV shows, as it used to be the case. Therefore, **minorities are getting finaly heard.** 

This has lead to very positive outcome, with a general mind opening on the matter of gay rights. On **june 26, 2015, the U.S Supreme court legalized same-sex marriage in the fifty states.**

In our data story, we are going to focus on the evolution of opinions regarding **LGBT community** in each states of the United States, with a special attention to politiciansâ€™s statements.
